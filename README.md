# My Projects Repository

This repository is a collection of files from my research projects and extra-curricular projects, all compiled in one place. It includes work from academic research, personal explorations, and other practical projects I have undertaken to develop and showcase my skills. I expect this to grow increasingly more in size as I develop my mathematical and statistical background and abilities.
